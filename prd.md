## 1. Purpose

To create a mobile and web-based application that helps users organize furniture and d√©cor in their home according to Feng Shui principles. The application will take a room layout (via scan, blueprint upload, or manual input) and generate optimized furniture arrangements that improve energy flow, harmony, and functionality.

## 2. Background & Motivation

Modern urban living often leads to disorganized or poorly arranged furniture that can impact mood, productivity, and wellness. Feng Shui is an ancient Chinese practice that promotes harmony through spatial arrangement and energy balance. This app leverages traditional Feng Shui rules, modern AI, and spatial recognition to help users harmonize their homes with minimal effort.
